    #[[TCP/IP Model]]
      What is it?
        TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) means it will be a controlled flow of data between two endpoints.
        IP (Internet Protocol) states how the packets are addressed and sent.
        
        Before sending data via TCP, you must establish and maintain a connection with a three-way handshake. 
        This process starts with the client sending a request called a SYN (SYNchronise) bit. 
        The server then should send a the same SYN bit back as well as an ACKnowledgement, known as an ACK.
        Finally, the client sends the ACK bit back to the server, successfully completing the three-way handshake.
        Using this method, the Client and Server both send information to eachother confirming the request.
        No TCP connection is established without the successful completion of a three-way handshake.
